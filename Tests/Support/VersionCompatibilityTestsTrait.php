/**
 * Asserts that the tests run against a supported TYPO3 version, and against the
 * version they have been started for.
 *
 * The version to run the tests for is selected with the option `-t` of
 * `runTests.sh`, while the dependencies are installed separately. A run against
 * the dependencies of another version therefore looks like a regular one, and
 * fails somewhere in the middle of the suite where the cause is hard to
 * recognize.
 *
 * `runTests.sh` passes `--exclude-group not-core-<version>` for the version
 * given with `-t`, so exactly the pinned test of that version remains, and it
 * fails right away if another version is installed.
 *
 * The group names are written out rather than composed from constants, so that
 * they can be found together with the `--exclude-group` arguments which use
 * them.
 *
 * Both test suites use this trait, so they cannot drift apart.
